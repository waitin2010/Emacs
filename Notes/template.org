* Document Template
  
** Purpose
   Try to avoid doing trivial monotonous tasks.
** Finding Strategy
   When a new file is created, Emacs searches for a template with a name based on the file's extension such as TEMPLATE.<extension>.tpl.
   Finding Strategy:
   1. current directory and it templates subdirectory
   2. parent directory and it emplates subdirectory
   3. grandparent directory and it templates subdirectory.
** stand-ins
   The tempaltes con contain ordinary text combined with stand-ins.
   These  stand-ins either are replaced with other text or mark positions in the buffer at the time a new file is created based on this template.
   Form: >>>stand-ins<<<
